Tongbupan push service uses websocket. Got permission from emacle.com. Thanks go to ralph & chao tian.

I developed this program when I wroked for the company emacle(http://www.tongbupan.com).

Road Map:<br>
1.make code more open source, for example: class & package name format.<br>
2.share benchmark and do more, etc.<br>
3.a lot, just beginning.<br>

Notice:<br>
1.All ip, users and passwords are replaced by nonsense.<br>
2.At the beginning, just share code and part of doc, I will complete these, then make and follow the roadmap.<br>
